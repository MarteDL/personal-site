                Hello there! I am Marte and I will be <b>28 years old</b> on the 5th of December. I spent most of my life in
                Lier and
                Antwerp but moved to Leuven 1,5 years ago. In my spare time I love to climb (both indoors and
                outdoors), play boardgames like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Wonders_(board_game)"
                    target="_blank">7 Wonders</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)"
                    target="_blank">Dominion</a>, and read fantasy books. My favourite book series are:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/books.asp" target="_blank">The Kingkiller
                        Chronicle</a> – Patrick Rothfuss</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/books-and-art/#cosmere" target="_blank">The Cosmere</a> –
                    Brandon Sanderson</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.robinhobb.com/works.htm" target="_blank">The Realm of the Elderlings</a> – Robin
                    Hobb</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the past year I have developed a love for <b>coffee</b> and <b>running</b>. Especially the second one
                is something
                I would have never thought possible since I was a “running is boring” kind of person. So a big thanks to
                the lockdown for changing my perspective on this.
            </p>

            <h2 id="my-education">My education</h2>
            <p>
                During my teenage years I went to high school in Lier where I followed the science-mathematics track.
                Upon graduating I moved to Antwerp to study the <b>mandolin</b> at the <a
                    href="https://www.ap.be/en/royal-conservatoire-antwerp" target="_blank">Royal Conservatory</a>.
                Right after I got my
                <b>master’s degree</b> in music in 2015, I studied for one more year so I could get my
                <b>teacher’s degree</b>. For those wondering what kind of instrument the mandolin is, here is a video of
                me performing with my former ensemble <em>Toccanti</em> in 2019.<br />
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yg5Dz8LEykA" frameborder="0"

            </p>
            <p>
                I learned a lot during my years at the Conservatory so I don’t regret going there. However,
                during my years as a student, freelance musician and teacher I realized that wasn’t the right career
                path for
                me. That is when I decided to go live in <b>England</b> and work as an <b>au pair</b> for a year to
                improve my English, get to know another culture and figure out my next step. That year completely
                changed me for the better and is one of the best parts of my life so far.

            <p>
                After my year abroad came the challenge of finding a job with my very specific master’s degree and not a
                lot of working experience outside that field. Thankfully it didn’t take too long before I could start working in
                <b>customer services</b>. This was a great way to get some experience in dealing with clients and also gave me a chance to get
                to know the workings of a big company. Here is a little overview of the <b>jobs</b> I’ve had these past
                three years.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <table>
                    <thead>

                            <td>Company</td>

                At each of these companies I acquired <b>skills</b> that have already helped me so much, both in my
                personal and
                professional life. Some of them are:
            <ul>
                <li>(Client-) communication</li>
                <li>Teamwork</li>
                <li>Planning</li>
                <li>Organizational skills</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1 id="about-coding"><i class="fas fa-code"></i> About coding</h1>
        <div>
            <h2 id="my-reasons">My reasons</h2>
            <p>
                During my career in the socio-cultural sector and later tourism, I always felt like something was
                missing. That is why I started looking into <b>different career paths</b>. First I just talked about it
                with
                friends who mentioned coding, among other things. Once I became more serious about changing jobs I went
                to a <b>job coach</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This decision turned out to be my salvation. After a few conversations it became clear that a job in
                IT and more specifically coding, could be perfect for me. In my previous jobs the days I liked most
                were when I could <b>delve deep</b> in the programs (like Axapta, CMS,...) we were working with or when
                I
                could <b>optimize</b> an extensive Excel sheet or other more technical tasks. What cleared things up
                most for
                me was the result of my <b>‘career anchors’</b> test. My most important ones are:
            <ol>
                <li>Technical/functional competence</li>
                <li>Pure challenge</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Simply put, the first anchor means that I need a job in which I can learn <b>technical skills</b> in a
                certain
                area and continue to <b>develop</b> those skills to an increasingly higher level. I love exceeding in
                something, being a specialist people come to for help and always going further on a technical level. The
                'challenge' anchor is very straight-forward: it gives me a lot of satisfaction when I can <b>solve</b> a
                seemingly unsolvable <b>problem</b>
                or overcome difficult obstacles. The possibility to keep on learning, variety and overcoming challenges
                or difficulties are what makes (and keeps) a job interesting to me.

            <h2 id="my-journey">My journey so far</h2>
            <p>
                <img id="freecodecamp" src="freeCodeCamp.jpg" alt="" />
                During the past couple of months I started going over the tutorials and challenges on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"
                    target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> to make absolutely sure whether programming was the job for me. At
                the same time I worked as a <b>waitress</b> to provide for myself so I only had some time before or
                after a shift but still <b>I loved it</b>. After working a 10 hour-shift in 35&#8451 it completely
                <b>relaxed</b> me to do some exercises in JavaScript. I also started talking a lot with one of my
                programmer friends and realized that to really go for it I would have to register for a full-time training.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is when I went looking for the best programming course for me. At first I focused on trainings
                organized by VDAB and Intec. However, after some research I didn’t feel like any of them were the right
                fit for me so I kept on looking and eventually found <a href="https://becode.org/learn/junior-web-developer/"
                    target="_blank">BeCode</a> two weeks ago. Ever since then I have been doing <b>excercises</b>
                on <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/20342726" target="_blank">Sololearn</a> non-stop as well
                as writing <b>my own website</b> (thank you Koen, for the great workshop and planting the idea in my
                head). After joining the BeCode <b>Discord</b> and following some of their <b>workshops</b>, I am now
                1000% (the extra 0 is not a typo) sure that this is the course for me. The main reasons for this
                are:
            <ul>
                <li>Active pedagogy is the best way to learn for me</li>
                <li>The broad content of the course in the beginning</li>
                <li>The possibility of specializing later on in the training</li>
                <li>The intensity of the course</li>
                <li>The internship at the end of the training</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 id="my-future">My future</h2>
            <p>
                One of my friends (a .NET developer) and I have talked about writing a <b>coffee-app</b> to keep track
                of the different kinds of coffees
                and coffee making methods people use so I am very excited to start working on that. But my first goal is
                to get into the BeCode training and become the best programmer I can possibly be.
            </p>
            <p>
                With all the information I have now I feel the jobs that I would like the most are <b>back-end
                    developer</b> or <b>full-stack developer</b> but who knows… Maybe I end up liking the front-end even
                more.
                That is what I love about coding. There is such a big world behind our screens and so many languages,
                specialties and ways to go. <b>I cannot wait</b> to explore them full-time!
